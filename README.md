## Abstract
Morrey’s conjecture deals with two properties of functions which are known as
quasi-convexity and rank-one convexity. It is well established that every func-
tion satisfying the quasi-convexity property also satisfies rank-one convexity.
Morrey (1952) conjectured that the reversed implication will not always hold.
In 1992, Šverák found a counterexample that can be generalized to any function
with domain of dimension n ≥ 2 and codomain of n ≥ 3, proving that Morrey
conjecture is true. The case of n = m = 2 remains, however, open. Check-
ing analytically these notions is a very difficult task as the criterion to check
quasiconvexity of functions is of non-local type, especially for vector-valued
functions. Nevertheless, in view of these difficulties we develop some numerical
schemes to verify if a given function has rank one convexity property but is not
quasiconvex. Our numerical results seem to confirm Morrey’s Conjecture.
